1. Introduction

Welcome to Trivia League and other apps and games developed by Falcon Game Studio.
Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our mobile applications.

2. Information We Collect

We design our apps to collect as little personal data as possible.
Depending on the app, we may collect:

Non-personal data: such as device type, operating system, app version, and gameplay statistics (used to improve app performance and fix bugs).

Ad and analytics data: if ads or analytics are enabled (e.g., Google AdMob, Firebase Analytics). These services may collect identifiers like advertising IDs for showing personalized or non-personalized ads.

We do not collect names, email addresses, or personal contact information unless the app specifically asks for it (and you consent).

3. How We Use Information

We use collected data to:

Improve gameplay experience and app performance

Fix bugs and crashes

Show relevant ads (if enabled)

Understand how users interact with our apps (for better updates)

4. Third-Party Services

Our apps may use third-party tools such as:

Google AdMob (for ads)

Firebase Analytics / Crashlytics (for app performance and error tracking)

These third parties have their own privacy policies that describe how they handle your information:

Google AdMob & Firebase Privacy Policy

5. Data Retention

We retain non-personal data only for as long as needed to improve app performance and meet legal requirements.
No personal information is stored on our servers unless explicitly provided by you.

6. Children’s Privacy

Our apps are not designed for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from them.
If we learn that we have inadvertently collected data from a child under 13, we will delete it immediately.

7. Your Privacy Rights

You can:

Opt out of personalized ads from your device’s settings (under Google Settings → Ads → Opt out of Ads Personalization).

Uninstall the app at any time to stop data collection.

8. Security

We take reasonable steps to protect your information against unauthorized access or misuse.
However, please note that no system is completely secure.

9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally.
Any changes will be posted within the app or on our website with the updated date.
